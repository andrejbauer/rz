- BUG (2004-12-30) [Andrej]:
  Fix Outsyn.IsPredicate so that it refers not only to the
  predicate name but also its underlying type.

- NEW (2004-12-22) [Andrej]:
  allow parametrized axioms to be turned into polymorphic functions
  (when possible) instead of functors.

- BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  missing obligations in output code for "let [x] = p in e"
  and "let x % r = p in e ".

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Make variable names more consistent. The rule is: delete all the
  vowels, except in the following cases:

    totality -> tot
    substitution -> sub

  Make sure that all the exceptional names contain vowels.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Rename "thy" to "thr" XOR rename ".thr" to ".thy"

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Use fewer implementations of contexts, maybe.

- NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add abbreviations for common groups of assertions (such as "is a per").
  Allow the user to use or not via run-time option.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Comment source code.
    
- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Allow constant definitions of functions with arguments. Right now
  a function must be defined as an explicit lambda abstraction.

    [What should the syntax be?]

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Add inductively defined sets which translate to (nice) recursive types.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Improve the toplevel program.

    [2004-07-01 CAS:  Done so far:
      *  Uses OCaml's generic command-line-option-processing functions 
         (the Arg library module), 
      *  Writes output to .mli files that could be run through
         ocamldoc, though the result is currently not pretty.
      *  Handles multiple filenames, and later files can refer to
         definitions in the earlier ones; see semilattice.thr
         and kuratowski2.thr.
     What else do we want to do?]
     

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Write more examples

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Write paper & tutorial (2004-06-17)
