- BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  when a parametrized axiom is translated, some assertions are
  missing in the hypotheses (the "trivial" ones)

- BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  missing obligations in output code for "let [x] = p in e"
  and "let x % r = p in e ".

- VERIFY (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  do we allow sum type subtyping? What form precisely? Should we do this?

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Make variable names more consistent. The rule is: delete all the
  vowels, except in the following cases:

    totality -> tot
    substitution -> sub

  Make sure that all the exceptional names contain vowels.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Rename "thy" to "thr" OR rename ".thr" to ".thy"

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Use fewer implementations of contexts.

- NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add abbreviations for common groups of assertions (such as "is a per").
  Allow the use to use or not use them via run-time option.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Comment source code.
    
- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Improve pretty-printing of output.
    
- NEW (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Add implicit superset conversions, if this is a reasonable thing to do.

- VERIFY (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Make sure only first-order functors are allowed.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Allow top level model declarations.

- BUG (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Disallow shadowing of sets, values and arguments of
  axioms.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Allow constant definitions of functions with arguments. Right now
  a function must be defined as an explicit lambda abstraction.

- NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add "there exists exactly one"

- NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add the description operator "the x : s . phi"

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Add inductively defined sets which translate to (nice) recursive types.

- NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Copy comments from the theory files to the output.

- IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Improve the toplevel program.

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Write more examples

- NEW (2004-06-17):
  Write paper & tutorial (2004-06-17)
