\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

Here are some possible examples.

Decidable sets to point out the difference between a general modest
set and one whose equality is actually computable.

The difference between the theory of a group and theory of (finitely
presentable) groups.

Finite sets as the free join-semilattice.

Axiom of choice is not realizable. This example is needed to point out
that we are not doing propositions-as-types. But intensional axiom of
choice is realized.

Real numbers and exact arithmetic, if there is space.
