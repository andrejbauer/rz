\comment{The following either goes into future work, or else into a
  discussion of the free join semilattice (where polymorphism would
  yield a fold-like operator).}  The translation of axioms
parameterized by models into polymorphism (instead of functors) is
essentially the phase-splitting translation of Harper, Mitchell, and
Moggi \cite{harper+:popl90}.
