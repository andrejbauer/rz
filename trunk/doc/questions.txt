    Is the boolean type in the abstract syntax an
    abbreviation for a specific sum type, or is it distinct?
    This would mean True and False are/are not abbreviating injections.

    If we're really not going to allow higher-order logic, shouldn't
    the parser reflect this?

    Why is there no case for Quotients in the Logic.set type?
    Also, no case for Choose in Logic.term.

    Will we need dependent types for functions/tuples/records (e.g., Pi
    and Sigma types)
