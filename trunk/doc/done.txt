  BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  a realizer for an axiom is not applied to the correct
  arguments in the corresponding assertion (some are missing)

  BUG (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Disallow shadowing of sets, values and arguments of
  axioms.

  VERIFY (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  do we allow sum type subtyping? What form precisely? Should we do this?

    [We do allow width subtyping on sums
        t1 + ... + tn + ...  <:   t1 + ... + tn
     because otherwise you could not pass the value `false to
     a function expecting an argument of type `false+`true.]

  NEW (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Add implicit superset conversions, if this is a reasonable thing to do.

    [I added an automatic conversion from a subset type to a
     NON-subset type in some cases.  (For technical reasons, this
     does not occur in an un-annotated equality; more precisely,
     the conversion is done when computing subtyping but not when
     computing joins.)
   
     Handling nested subset types in general would be more painful.]
