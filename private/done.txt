  IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17):
  Improve the toplevel program.

    [2004-07-01 CAS:  Done so far:
      *  Uses OCaml's generic command-line-option-processing functions 
         (the Arg library module), 
      *  Writes output to .mli files that could be run through
         ocamldoc, though the result is currently not pretty.
      *  Handles multiple filenames, and later files can refer to
         definitions in the earlier ones; see semilattice.thr
         and kuratowski2.thr.
     What else do we want to do?]

  IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Make variable names more consistent. The rule is: delete all the
  vowels, except in the following cases:

    totality -> tot
    substitution -> sub

  Make sure that all the exceptional names contain vowels.

  IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Rename "thy" to "thr" XOR rename ".thr" to ".thy"

- DONE (<< 2004-02-06)
  NEW (2005-01-03) [Both]:
  Add support for applications of parameterized theories and 
  parameterized models (to model arguments).

- DONE (<< 2004-12-30)
  NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add abbreviations for common groups of assertions (such as "is a per").

- DONE (2004-12-30)
  IMPROVEMENT (2004-12-30) [Chris]:
  Add the --nosave/--save command line option to avoid saving .mli files.

- DONE (2004-12-30)
  IMPROVEMENT (2004-12-30) [Chris]:
  Print

    assure _ : top . phi in t

  as

    assure phi in t

- DONE (2004-12-30)
  BUG (2004-06-29) [Andrej]:
  the underlying type of a predicate such as < cannot be
  called < as well. Should be something like lt.

  [Perhaps the choice of names could be optimized some more,
   see Logic.typename_of_name and Logic.typename_of_longname.]

- DONE (2004-12-30)
  NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add "there exists exactly one"

- DONE (2004-12-30)
  NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  Add the description operator "the x : s . phi"

- DONE (2004-06-30)
  IMPROVEMENT (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Improve pretty-printing of output.
    
- DONE (2004-06-30) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Allow top level model declarations.


- DONE (2004-06-30)
  BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  when a parametrized axiom is translated, some assertions are
  missing in the hypotheses (the "trivial" ones)

  [Parametrized axioms are now translated into functors.]


- DONE (2004-06-30)
  NEW (2004-06-17) [Andrej & Chris]:
  Copy comments from the theory files to the output.

- DONE [2004-06-18]
  BUG (2004-06-17) [Andrej]:
  a realizer for an axiom is not applied to the correct
  arguments in the corresponding assertion (some are missing)

- DONE [2004-06-28]
  BUG (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Disallow shadowing of sets, values and arguments of
  axioms.

- DONE [2004-06-28]
  VERIFY (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  do we allow sum type subtyping? What form precisely? Should we do this?

    [We do allow width subtyping on sums
        t1 + ... + tn + ...  <:   t1 + ... + tn
     because otherwise you could not pass the value `false to
     a function expecting an argument of type `false+`true.]

- DONE [2004-06-29]
  NEW (2004-06-17) [Chris]:
  Add implicit superset conversions, if this is a reasonable thing to do.

    [I added an automatic conversion from a subset type to a
     NON-subset type in some cases.  (For technical reasons, this
     does not occur in an un-annotated equality; more precisely,
     the conversion is done when computing subtyping but not when
     computing joins.)
   
     Handling nested subset types in general would be more painful.]
