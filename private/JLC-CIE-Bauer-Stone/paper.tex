\begin{abstract}
  Realizability theory 
\iflong 
  is not just a fundamental tool in logic
  and computability.  It also 
  has direct application to the design and
  implementation of programs, since it
\fi % \iflong
  can produce code interfaces for the data
  structure corresponding to a
  mathematical theory.
%
  Our tool, called RZ,
  serves as a bridge between
\iflong the worlds of \fi
  constructive
  mathematics and programming% 
\iflong 
.
By using the realizability
  interpretation of constructive mathematics, RZ 
  translates
\else
\ by translating
\fi % \iflong 
  specifications in constructive logic into annotated
  interface code in Objective Caml.
%
  The system supports
  a rich input language allowing descriptions of
  complex mathematical structures. RZ does not extract code from
  proofs, but allows any implementation method, from handwritten code to code extracted from
  proofs by other tools.
