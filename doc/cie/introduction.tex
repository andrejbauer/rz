\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Introduction and motivation, including initial examples.

What are we trying to tell the reader?  (Ideally, we'd concentrate on just one or two themes)

I guess we are trying to tell the reader that realizaiblity has not
only proven to be a fundamental theoretical tool in logic and PL, but
can also be used to implement an actual tool for writing
specifications. Can you think of a better selling point?

\begin{itemize}
\item Here's why you'll want to use the RZ tool
\item Here's a cool application of some theoretical results.
\item Here's why realizability interpretations
  are important.
\item Here are the practical issues involved in computing realizability
  interpretations.
\item Here's the history of the development of RZ
\item Here's a worked example of a realizability interpretation for a non-trivial language involving dependent types.
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}
