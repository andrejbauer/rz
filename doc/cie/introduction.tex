Introduction and motivation, including initial examples.

What are we trying to tell the reader?  (Ideally, we'd concentrate on just one or two themes)
\begin{itemize}
\item Here's why you'll want to use the RZ tool
\item Here's a cool application of some theoretical results.
\item Here's why realizability interpretations
  are important.
\item Here are the practical issues involved in computing realizability
  interpretations.
\item Here's the history of the development of RZ
\item Here's a worked example of a realizability interpretation for a non-trivial language involving dependent types.
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}
