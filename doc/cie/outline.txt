TITLE:

Sections:
* Introduction/Motivation
* Examples
   [cs: Even people not interested in the details can probably read the examples,
    so it would be better if we could move them early.]
* What RZ is (Semantics)
   * Source language: terms and logic 
   * Realizability translation
      * Something about realizers being total/terminating
* How RZ works (Implementation)
   * Parsing and typechecking occur
      *  Not much to say except perhaps for mentioning subtyping/coercions
   * Translation
   * TopTy and thinning
   * Optimization occurs
      * Simplifications, but not any real theorem-proving.
   * Phase-splitting:  functors into polymorphism
* Comparison with Coq extraction tool
   [cs: see e-mail?]
* Future work
