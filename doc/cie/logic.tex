The input to RZ consists of one or more theories.
A RZ \emph{theory} is a generalized logical signature with associated
axioms, similar to a Coq module signature. Theories describe
of \emph{models}, or implementations. A summary of the input
language appears in Figure~\ref{fig:input}.

\iflong
The simplest theory $\ith$ is a list of \emph{theory element}\/s
$\ite_1 \ldots \ite_n$. A theory element may specify that a certain
set, set element, proposition or predicate, or model must exist (using
the 
\textsf{Parameter} keyword). It may also provide a definition
of a set, term, proposition, predicate, or theory (using the 
\textsf{Definition} keyword). Finally, a theory element can be
a named axiom (using the \textsf{Axiom} keyword).

We allow model parameters in theories; 
typical examples in mathematics include
the theory of a vector space parameterized by a field of scalars,
or the theory of the real numbers parameterized by a model of the
natural numbers.
Following Sannella, Sokolowski, and 
Tarlecki\footnote{``parameterized (program specification) $\neq$ (parameterized program) specification''}~\cite{sannella92:_towar} RZ supports two forms of parameterization.  A theory of a parameterized implementation
$\idarrow{\iM}{\ith_1}{\ith_2}$ describes a uniform family of models (i.e.,
a single implementation; a functor in OCaml) that maps every
model~$\im$ satisfying~$\ith_1$ to a model of~$\ith_2$.  In contrast,
a theory $\ilambda{\iM}{\ith_1}{\ith_2}$
maps models to theories; if $\iTH$ is such a theory, then
$\iTH(\im_1)$ and $\iTH(\im_2)$ are theories whose implementations might be completely unrelated.\footnote{
Further, in some cases $\iTH(\im_1)$ might be implementable while $\iTH(\im_2)$ is not.
}


Propositions and predicates appearing in theories may use full
first-order constructive logic, not just the negative fragment. The
grammar for logical inputs is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:input}. Most of
this should be familiar, including the use of lambda abstraction to
define predicates.

The language of sets is rich, going well beyond the type systems of
typical programming languages. In addition to any base sets postulated
in a theory, one can construct dependent cartesian products and
dependent function spaces. We also supports disjoint unions (with
labeled tags), quotient spaces (a set modulo a stable equivalence
relation), subsets (elements of a set satisfying a predicate). RZ even
permits explicit references to sets of realizers.
\fi

Note that term language follows the structure of the set level by providing
introduction and elimination constructs. For product sets we have
tuples and projections ($\iproj{\ie}{1}$, $\iproj{\ie}{2}$, \ldots),
and for function spaces we have lambda abstractions and application.
One can inject a term into a tagged disjoin union, or do case analyses
on the members of a union. We can produce the equivalence class or pick a representative of a given equivalence class (as
long as what we do with it does not depend on the particular
representative). Very similarly, we can produce a set of realizers
or choose a representative from a given set of realizers
(as long as what we do with it does not depend on the particular
representative). We can inject a term into a subset (if it satisfies
the appropriate predicate), or project an element of a subset into the
enclosing set. Finally, the term language also allows local
definitions of term variables, and definite descriptions (as long as
there is a unique element satisfying the predicate in question).

From the parenthesized qualifiers in the previous paragraph, it is
clear that checking the well-formedness of terms is not decidable. RZ
checks what it can, but does not attempt any serious theorem proving.
Uncheckable constraints remain as obligations
in the final output, and must be verified by other means; the output
can then be trusted to the extent that the obligations are satisfied.
