\begin{abstract}
  We show that realizability is not only a fundamental tool in logic
  and computability, but also has direct application to the design and
  implementation of programs: it can produce a description of the data
  structure (a code interface) directly corresponding to a
  mathematical theory.

  Our claims are supported by an implementation of a tool, called RZ,
  which is to serve as a bridge between the world of constructive
  mathematics and the programming world. By using the realizability
  interpretation of constructive mathematics, RZ automatically
  translates specifications in constructive logic into standard
  interface code in a programming language, currently Objective Caml.

  RZ was specifically designed as a lightweight system, despite
  supporting a very rich input language that allows descriptions of
  complex mathematical structures. RZ does not extract code from
  proofs, but allows the programmer to implement the specifications in
  any fashion, ranging from hand-writen code to code extracted from
  proofs by other tools.
